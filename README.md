# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and gaining insights from an e-commerce platform's sales data. The primary objectives are to identify sales trends, understand customer behavior, assess product performance, and develop predictive models that forecast future sales and recommend products to customers. These insights aim to help the e-commerce company optimize marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer retention.

## Problem Statement

The e-commerce industry is highly competitive, and companies must leverage data to make informed decisions. By analyzing transactional data, we can uncover patterns and trends that are not immediately apparent. This project seeks to:

- Identify sales trends over time and across regions.
- Understand customer purchasing behaviors and preferences.
- Evaluate product performance to highlight bestsellers and underperforming items.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future sales and customer behavior.
- Enhance marketing strategies through targeted recommendations.
- Optimize inventory management to reduce costs and meet customer demand.
- Improve customer retention by offering personalized experiences.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Transaction_ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Product_ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Transaction_Date**: Date and time when the transaction occurred.
- **Units_Sold**: Number of units of the product sold in the transaction.
- **Discount_Applied**: Discount applied to the transaction, if any.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated from the transaction.
- **Clicks**: Number of clicks on the product listing or advertisement.
- **Impressions**: Number of times the product listing or advertisement was viewed.
- **Conversion_Rate**: Percentage of clicks that resulted in a sale.
- **Category**: Category to which the product belongs.
- **Region**: Geographic region where the transaction occurred.
- **Ad_CTR**: Click-through rate of the advertisement (Clicks/Impressions).
- **Ad_CPC**: Cost per click of the advertisement.
- **Ad_Spend**: Total amount spent on advertising for the transaction.

  - Used regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) for forecasting.
- **Customer Churn Prediction**:
  - Built classification models to predict customer churn.
  - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Recommendation Systems

- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - Implemented user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
  - Used the Surprise library for model building.
- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - Recommended products based on product features and customer profiles.

### 5. Advertising Effectiveness Analysis

- **Ad Performance Metrics**: Calculated ROI, CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), and LTV (Lifetime Value) metrics.
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Suggested reallocating budget to high-performing ads and tweaking underperforming ones.

### 6. Model Evaluation and Validation
